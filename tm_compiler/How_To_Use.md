I can be more specific later.

Follow the format shown in the two examples, 'my_primality_tm.txt' and 'even_checker_tm.txt'

If you need help designing a TM, use https://github.com/andreicozma1/STEM/releases/tag/v2.0.1

Empty tape positions are represented by '\_'

Wild-Card is represented by '~'

You can use strings in the TM design

Default starting position is always tape_0

Exectute as:   

    python gen_hofstadter_tm.py [TM File] [Tape Length] (tape_input)
  
    python hofstadter.py hofstadter_tm.txt

Try:

    python gen_hofstadter_tm.py my_primality_tm.txt 11 1111111
  
    python hofstadter.py hofstadter_tm.txt
